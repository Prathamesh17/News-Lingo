# FakeNewsDetection

The explosive growth in fake news and its erosion to democracy, justice, and
public trust has increased the demand for fake news analysis, detection and
intervention. This project comprehensively and systematically reviews fake news
research. The project identifies and specifies fundamental theories across various
disciplines, e.g., psychology and social science, to facilitate and enhance the
interdisciplinary research of fake news. Current fake news studies is reviewed,
summarized and evaluated.

These studies focus on fake news from four perspective:

(1) the false knowledge it carries,
(2) its writing style,
(3) its propagation patterns, and
(4) the credibility of its creators and spreaders.

We characterize each perspective with various analyzable and utilizable
information provided by news and its spreaders, various strategies and frameworks
that are adaptable, and techniques that are applicable. By reviewing the
characteristics of fake news and open issues in fake news studies, we highlight
some potential research tasks at the end of this project report.
